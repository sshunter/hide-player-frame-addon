# hide-player-frame-addon

Hides the player frame in WoW

There is no UI for this. If its enabled, the player frame will be hidden. If it's
disabled, it reverts to the default behaviour and the player frame will be shown.

I created this to use with addons like
<https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/solo-raid-frame-nv> since that, along
with WeakAuras, makes the player frame largely redundant.

My WoW sub is currently lapsed; I am mostly checking this in so I can find it
late and, likewise, I can't currently test if the addon works with Classic or
Cataclysm Classic.
